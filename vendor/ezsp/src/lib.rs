//! Host-side support for the `EmberZNet` Serial Protocol (`EZSP`).
//!
//! EZSP is the protocol used by a host application processor to communicate
//! with the `EmberZNet` PRO stack running on a Network Co-Processor (`NCP`).
//! Commands are sent by the host and answered by the `NCP`; UART-based NCPs may
//! additionally send asynchronous callbacks as they occur.
//!
//! This crate provides typed EZSP frame headers, parameter structures, and
//! command traits on top of an actor-based transport. Independent [`Transmit`]
//! and [`Receive`] implementations are driven by futures that the caller spawns
//! as tasks. Those actors serialize outgoing work, correlate responses by EZSP
//! sequence number, and route asynchronous callbacks separately. After protocol
//! negotiation, a cloneable [`Connection`] handle implements [`Communicate`]
//! and therefore all command-group traits.
//!
//! [`Builder`] orchestrates actor startup, protocol negotiation, stack
//! configuration, network restoration or formation, endpoint registration,
//! and callback translation. The resulting [`Ncp`] adds higher-level scan and
//! APS messaging workflows.
//!
//! This crate does not supply an `ASHv2` implementation. An external `ASHv2`
//! adapter implements [`Transmit`] and [`Receive`], passes both halves to
//! [`Client::run`], and spawns the returned [`Futures`] before constructing
//! [`Builder`] from the newly wired [`Client`].
//!
//! Protocol details are documented by Silicon Labs in the
//! [Simplicity SDK EZSP Reference Guide](https://docs.silabs.com/zigbee/latest/sisdk-ezsp-reference-guide/).
//!
//! This library is free software and is not affiliated with Silicon Labs.
